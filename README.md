# BeeMon

BeeMon is an open source software/hardware system to automate bee hive monitoring. 
The goal of this project is to design a system that is:

- cheap to buy
- simple to set up and
- rock solid in operation

The program code you're looking at is the implementation of BeeMon's web interface
and it's Node.js based counter-part (server) which interacts with the linux USB 
hardware sensors and actors officially supported by BeeMon.

This is open source software. Feel free to freely copy, modify and use it.
If you like it, feel free to support us.

We are working on the translation.

## Goal

To improve the health of bee colonies - world-wide.
